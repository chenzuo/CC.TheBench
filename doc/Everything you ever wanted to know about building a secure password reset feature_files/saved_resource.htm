<p>One could leverage the account notification functionality to malign your service by sending lots of spurious emails. Additionally it would load your mail server with email it wouldn't need to send.</p>

                                    <p>That's certainly a potential risk Ugo and there are mitigations along the same lines as you'd apply to other brute force attacks (i.e. throttle resets by IP, prolong the request by putting the thread to sleep for a couple of seconds, etc). There's also not a lot of upside for an attacker beyond causing inconvenience to the target.</p>

<p>On the flip side, people forget the username or email they signed up to a service with. Assuming you don't want to create an account enumeration risk by disclosing account presence via the browser, email is the only channel you have to privately notify the address that their account doesn't actually exist. I would argue the ability impact of having no feedback to legitimate customers who've simply forgotten which identity they signed up under outweighs the potential risk of brute force when appropriate mitigation is in place.</p>

<p>To deal with Ugo's concern, you could code in a limit to how often a "No Account Exists" mail can be sent.  Restricting to sending this particular email once per day, keeps the malicious party from using you to spam someone, while allowing the flow to work as intended.  This restriction would be on this flow only of course and would not affect how often you can send a "real" reset email.</p>

                                    <p>It's a good point, the issue then is who the "attacker" in this case is targeting. Yes, you could limit emails to a particular recipient but if their goal is "to malign your service by sending lots of spurious emails" then they could just keep plugging in random email addresses.</p>

<p>My preference would be to use a mail service like MailGun or SendGrid which should be able to handle any load a single site throws at it and has an exceptionally low cost (plus other good reasons to use them). You're really not left with much of an upside for the attacker and things will almost certainly break upstream of the mail service first (i.e. site DDoS'd).</p>

Throw a "unknown error" or what?</p>

                                    <p>You can approach this the same way as you would the reset process - don't disclose the existence of the account other than via email. For registration, what this means is that you begin the process with your email address and are then sent an email either with a link to continue the registration process or a notification saying you're already registered.</p>

<p>Of course the major downside here is usability; this is the very point where you want to make things easy for a potential registrant, not hard. Again, this is a trade-off between usability and security and each potential use case will need to find its own balance.</p>

                                    <p>Thank you for this nice post.<br>One little suggestion: You should store a hash of the reset-token in the database.<br>Assume someone gets read-only access to it through a SQLi. If your users (or especially your admins) picked strong passwords, an attacker shouldn't be able to escalate his privileges.<br>If you store the unhashed token in your database, an attacker would be able to dump those reset-links and set a new admin password.</p>

                                    <p>Great article.  I always use "false" answers to secret questions so even someone that knows me well (or thinks they do) will never get those answers correct.  Of course I have to remember them myself, but I've developed a stock set that I don't reuse much and don't use for anything else.  Such as Q: "What is your wife's favorite color", A: "OneIfByLand"</p>

                                    <p>Possibly the best article I've ever read on password/membership security. </p>

<p>An organisation with the resources and focus (Trustworthy Computing, anyone?) as Microsoft should bake this sort of thing into the product. ASP.NET Identity/Membership components should be world-class out-of-the-box. Not every website needs x^nFA, but a configurable option that enables quick and simple implementations of the features above just has to go into the product. Or at the very least into components we can grab from NuGet.</p>

That would definitely include secret answers and should also include the email address to initiate the reset.</p>

                                    <p>Excellent article. I wanted to raise a problem I've found with secret Q&amp;A sites. It falls under your criterion of specifity but I think is worth calling out - even when a question has only one answer, there may be several ways to phrase that answer. For example mother's maiden name could be "Jane Doe" or "jane doe" or "Doe" or "Jane Eve Doe", and so on.</p>

                                    <p>Lovely feedback, thank you!</p>

<p>I've read a couple of fantastic books recently which I learnt a lot from. Firstly there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wires-Adventures-Worlds-Wanted/dp/0316037702" rel="nofollow">Ghost in the Wires</a> by Kevin Mitnick about his exploits in the 80s and 90s (very interesting reading about social engineering). The other one I just finished is Parmy Olson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Inside-LulzSec-Insurgency/dp/0316213543/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1345551814&sr=1-1&keywords=parmy+anonymous" rel="nofollow">We Are Anonymous</a> which is about very recent events involving "Anonymous" which I found really helped me understand the thought process of these guys. Both highly recommended.</p>

                                    <p>Great Article. To the point and covers lots of areas that I am currently looking at improving in a toy app/ framework. <br>It's made me consider my User Creation/Registration scenarios as well though. Do you have another post (couldn't find one after several attempts, but could be hidden within one with a different sort of name) along the lines of: Everything you need to know about User Creation/registration, that also included a similar flow chart to the above? <br>Would really like to know your thoughts on the process of the order to collect information from a User for registration and how to get a password to a User or set that  a reset token is needed if an Admin creates a User.Cheers.</p>

                                    <p>My only beef with the article is the VERY personal and/or cultural biases in "secret questions" - they ALL assume something about the user that may well not be true:</p>

<p>"Name of your 3rd grade teacher" - hell, I don't remember anything before college - I certainly don't remember a 3rd grade teacher - do you spend your life thinking about 3rd grade?</p>

<p>"Your favorite movie/book/title" - do you really think we're all so simplistic as to have a single "favorite"? hell, what if a new favorite comes along?  We're not all 20-yo-geeks...</p>

<p>"where was your first date" - holy crap, I've lived a bit since then - do you spend your time obsessing on your first?</p>

<p>"your grandmother's nickname", etc, etc, etc</p>

<p>The problem with ALL "secret question" systems is they are expressions of the creator's life, not mine.  Even providing fake answers: how do you remember how you faked it?  did you fake it differently for site "A" vs site "B"?  In the complexity, it just makes it HARDER for users to remember, which means they are MORE likely to store in conveniently/insecurely...</p>

<p>I've found the reliance on secret question to tell me FAR more about the emotional level of the programmers creating them than anything else...<br></p>

                                    <p>Agreed, this is really why there needs to be a broad choice of possible secret questions and certainly there has to be objectivity applied to the selection criteria.</p>

<p>In terms of faking answers, I use a password manager to track both passwords and secret answers. I agree - it's too hard to remember the answers to many of the secret questions or like you say, you create fakes which makes it even worse. I usually just randomly generate string answers then they go straight into 1Password.</p>

                                    <p>Password managers like 1Password have no restriction on the number of attributes you can store so there's no problem securely tracking secret answers. You need to be selective in the secret questions you choose which is why variety is key. As I said <em>many</em> of the secret questions are hard to remember; I couldn't remember my 3rd grade teacher but I can easily remember my first car.</p>

<p>There are many poorly designed implementations, no doubt about it, but in a case like Apple's I think they've done a reasonable job of it. Could you really not recall the answer to any of those five questions they offered? If you are presented with a set of questions, none of which you can readily recall, then I'd agree that's a poor implementation.</p>

                                    <p>Hey Troy.  Great post, very thorough, very thoughtful, totally useful.  One suggested improvement, it seems to me that your advice about storing passwords ("hash! be sure to salt!") is, while necessary, insufficient.  It's not sufficient to use a hash, you need to use a slow/expensive hashing algorithm.  You've read codahale's article about this, right?</p>

                                    <p>The details are so easy to get wrong, and yet password storage and recovery is being reinvented (usually poorly) on a per-site basis.  Password management should really be built in to the major web frameworks.  Ideally, SQL databases would also have a Password column type and extensions for comparing a string to a Password (extract salt from Password and hash string behind the scenes).</p>

<p>Taking the output of a memory-hard hash function and multiplying by a generator point for an elliptic curve before storing would make the stored password hash also useful as a EC-SRP server-side secret.  We should really be migrating away from protocols that send passwords to the server at all.</p>

                                    <p>Not Kosh, but I don't like some of the Apple questions or the Paypal questions.</p>

<p>My problems are<br>(Apple)<br> - first car.  I don't drive.<br> - first teacher.  Who can remember that?  I can't.  I can remember some teachers but not the first one.  Could also be a problem for the home-schooled.<br> - city first kissed.  I wasn't first kissed in a city (or even a town).<br> - Where was your first job.  Maybe discoverable.  Also some people might not have had a job when they set up the account.<br> - first album owned.  Not sure I can remember. </p>

<p>(Paypal)<br> - first school.  Discoverable for a lot of people.  Problem for the home-schoolers.  <br> - first pet.  OK for me but some people don't have pets.<br> - hospital you were born in.  Some people are home-births.  Hosptial births are probably discoverable too (certainly guessable where there is only one hospital in a town).<br> - travel on honeymoon.  Not good for people who haven't married.<br> - childhood cuddly toy.  Not sure I had one with a name.  Not that I remember anyway.</p>

<p>Generally  I fake answers and store them in a password store due to this.  Which is good because I could only reliably answer 1 Apple question, and 3 Paypal questions (of which two are probably discoverable in my case).</p>

                                    <p>Security questions are not really helpful at all, because they are the same one every site   and can often been guessed by public information of the user (or by information gathered from other breaking in to other sites).</p>

<p>I would send a physical letter to the address of user instead of using security questions. You could also charge the user for this. If you are a site that can't afford it or doesn't deal with money, you probably don't need a security question either or should use other means of authentication.<br>I also recommend reading the Passwords Chapter from Peter Gutmanns Book Draft "Engineering Security" (<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdf)" rel="nofollow">www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001...</a> for further examples of attacks.</p>
